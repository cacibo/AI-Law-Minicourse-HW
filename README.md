SUPREME COURT TUTORIAL:
Step 1: collect and prepare data by importing into kernel. Link respository. And find ways to pull this data.
Step 2: Find a way to collect data and input it into table.
Step 3: Determine stop words by making a dictionary or vocabulary set.
Step 4: Test the models you created. Find what topics the cases are on and apply it to the data.
Step 5: Apply the model to the data.

WORD2VEC TUTORIAL:
Step 1: collect and prepare the data by downloading data to be used in the word2vec model. This can be done by downloading the scientific packages into the Python Kernel.
Step 2: create a dictionary of 50000 words and replace words with their corresponding codes. This will create a connection between the actual words and their applicable codes. This in turn builds a vocabulary or dicationary from which the code will reference.
Step 3: Try skip gram model for the first time using the words you inputted. Indicate the amount of data you want to use for this model.
Step 4: With the data specified in Step 3, build and train a skip gram model. Here, indicate how many words you want to use. Words are displayed in the order of their code.
Step 5: start the training of the gramp skip model. 
Step 6: build a graph from the embeddings.
